Next week is my last week in [Sharepointalist](https://sharepointalist.com/)... It was great 7 full-time years and 3 more as an remote frelancer/consultant. I had the opportunity to meet great collegues, work with different sizes of projects and customers. Together we started and evolved multiple products: [List Booster](http://www.spbooster.com/), [Navigator 365](https://sharepointalist.com/products/navigator), other products with our partners.

The company always supported me in self-development and community efforts. My initial steps were guieded by Sharepointalist; most of the community activities like speaking and contributions were done during business hours.
Honestly, it's hard to find an employer who will help you in your self-development as much as Sharepointalist did for me.
And it's hard to find an employer with such smart and responsive collegues as in Sharepointalist!
<br />

It was definitely the best experience so far! But it's time to turn things inside out :)

On August 16 I will retire my MVP award and join [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). I will become a part of ODSP team, or more precisely - WEX team that is responsible for SPFx, 1st-party web parts and other cool stuff!
I hope to bring my experience to make the platform better. But even more - I want to join a great team with great individuals that I know for few years. I'll definitely enjoy learning from them!

See you from the other side!
