Today the first v2 beta version of SharePoint Framework Reusable Controls has been released!
The main change in this version is the support of React v16 and Office UI Fabric (Fluent UI) v6.
Both these updates were well overdue for SharePoint Online development. But they also mean that v2 **will not support SharePoint On-Premise**.
There are some additional breaking changes for the [controls](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/blob/v2/docs/documentation/docs/guides/migrate-from-v1.md).
<br />
<br />
Currently we're in need of testing the v2 version and transition between v1 and v2.
Please, try out [v2 beta](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pnp/spfx-controls-react/v/2.0.0-beta.d9bbeed) and let us know if there are any [issues](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/issues).
<br />
<br />
That's all for today!<br />
Have fun!
