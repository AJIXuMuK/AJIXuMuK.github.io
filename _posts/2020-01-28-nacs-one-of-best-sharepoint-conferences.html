This year I'll be attending North American Collaboration Summit for the first time. And I'm really happy about that!<br />It's a great conference loaded with the best speakers and really interesting and helpful content!<br />There are workshops and sessions around SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Power Platform, security and so on! Every attendee will find some information to be used in day-to-day job. And it doesn't matter if you are a power user, developer, admin or executive! There is content for everyone!<br />And, because it is a non-profit event, the tickets are much cheaper than on other multi-day conferences!<br />My sessions are part of a developer track and focused on advanced features of SharePoint Framework<br />The first one is "SharePoint Framework Connected Web Parts" where you can learn how to connect multiple SharePoint Framework web parts (or event extensions) using Dynamic Data capability.<br />The second session, "Developing React Templates Using SharePoint Framework Library Components" describes how to create rich React templates and dynamically include them into you SharePoint Framework projects using SPFx Library Component solution type.<br >Hope to see you in Branson, April 2-3, 2020.<br />You can also use code TERENTIEV during the registration to save $50.<br />Register here: <a href="https://nacs.ticketspice.com/nacs2020" target="_blank">https://nacs.ticketspice.com/nacs2020</a><br /><br />Have fun!
