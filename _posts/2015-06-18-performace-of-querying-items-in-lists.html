Some time ago I was working on project where I needed to query items from several lists and document libraries (each list and library contained 200+ items). I needed to display Title and Url fields from lists and file name and file url from document libraries.<br />My first code worked too long and I've started to think about increasing the performance of queries.<br />And here are the things that helped me to increase speed in several times:<br /><br /><ol><li>Use &lt;ViewFields&gt; inside query instead of Include(...) inside ClientContext.Load()</li><li>Use FileRef and FileLeafRef fields instead of File field (which is an object with several properties in it).</li></ol><br />That's all. These two changes helped me a lot. And the customer is happy about the performance they have.<br />Have fun!
